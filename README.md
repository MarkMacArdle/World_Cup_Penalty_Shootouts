# World Cup Penalty Shoot-outs Data
Scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_penalty_shoot-outs) and analysed.

Shoot-outs go back to the first one in 1982.


# ToDo
Modify scraping script to also get [European Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UEFA_European_Championship_penalty_shoot-outs)
penalty data. The Wikipedia page looks to have the data in a very similar table.
